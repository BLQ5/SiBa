# SiBa
Simple Backup Application

The SiBa is a simple application used to create the incremental backup of a source directory. A target directory is synchronized with the source directory. Only the target directory is modified by backup. New files are copied to the target directory, modified files overwrite the existing ones, files deleted from the source directory are also deleted from the target directory.
